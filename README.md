# flash-cards

This flash cards project created with python will help you learn new words.

In my version I used french words translated to english but you can choose any language. Just change 'french_words.csv' file to yours but remember to do it in the same format as I did with my file and change the code so it will search for your file.

After launching the program you will see the word in french, after 3 seconds it will change to the english translation. You can click red button if you did not know the word. If you knew it you can press green button. After doing so, the program will create new file 'words_to_learn.csv'. It will contain the words you did not know.

After launching the program again, it will use the words from file 'words_to_learn.csv' so you will not have to go through words you knew.
